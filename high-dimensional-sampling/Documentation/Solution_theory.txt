Efficient sampling of high dimensional spaces with complex, non-linear constraints

The problem of efficient sampling of high-dimensional spaces with arbitrary constraints is
essentially an optimization problem with the objective of achieving n-dimensional maximum volume where:

independent variables = x1, x2, ..., xn
Objective function = x1 * x2 ... * xn
subjected to the following constraints:
g_i(x) >= 0

To solve this problem, I propose basin-hopping stochastic optimization method 
with two stages of local and global maximization at each iteration. Within basin-hopping
methodology, I use Monte Carlo optimization appraoch
The algorithm has the following stages:

1. Set the initial values for all variables
2. Find a local maximum using Constrained Optimization BY Linear Approximation (COBYLA) 
and Sequential Least SQuares Programming (SLSQP)
3. Add a random purturbation to the coordinates of the local maxmimum solution to displace
the point and explore potential non-local maximum solutions
4. Find the next local maximum around the new location and compare that to the previous
answer. If the new solution provides higher value for the objective function, then
replace the old solution with new one. Otherwise, keep the old solution.
5. continue this process until maximum number of candidates (set by user) is reached.
